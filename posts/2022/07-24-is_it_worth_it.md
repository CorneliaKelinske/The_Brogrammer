Is it worth it? Or: What I learned from creating my own projects

One piece of advice that is offered to aspiring new web developers is to leave the safe haven of tutorials and to
build own projects. I have followed this advice and can answer the title question with "Yes" (what a surprise!) and
here are some of the things I learned along the way.

The valuable insights that I am sharing in this post are based on my work on these projects:
  - -- this website 
  - -- The Little Thinker's Space (a photo/video sharing app I built for my son; (https://the-little-thinkers-space.fly.dev/)) 
  - -- ex_robo_cop (a light-weight captcha library; https://hexdocs.pm/ex_robo_cop/README.html)

But now, without further ado, here is what I have learned:

# 1. Using different library


# 2. The value of good typespecs


# 3. Some frontendy stuff 
Bulma CSS framework
Tailwind CSS 

# 4. Planning the big picture


# 5. Breaking it down into smaller steps (and losing the fear of writing the first line)


# 6. Dealing with setbacks


# 7. Refactoring


# 8. Different ways of deploying (heroku and digital ocean vs fly.io)


# 9. Don't touch the docker file (unless you absolute have to)


# 10. Others might not share the excitement - and that's okay
