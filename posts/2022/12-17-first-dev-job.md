It's been about two months since I started my first job as en Elixir developer. Here are some things I have learned and am still learning. They are not code.

# 1. A few words about my job


I am working on a small team with just one other full-time junior dev and our CTO. We are building a Phoenix/LiveView app for a small business from scratch. This has given me the opportunity to work on a variety of things including areas in which I had little prior experience, such as LiveView and frontendy stuff.

Needless to say, I have been learning a lot. And while I am amazed about how much more technical knowledge I have compared to when I started, I feel like I have learned (and am still learning) even more outside the code as such. Here is a collection of these non-code things I learned.


# 2. The importance of Git


My team uses GitHub, which is likely what the majority of dev teams are using to collaborate. It has been a huge advantage for me that I have been pushing code into GitHub repos from the very beginning of my coding journey and that I have been collaborating with others on GitHub. Thanks to this, I was familiar with the basic Git commands and - for the most part - knew my way around the repo, rebasing and the less pleasant things such as merge conflicts. If somebody asked me what I recommend new developers learn before starting in their first job, Git would be my no. 1 recommendation. There is a ton of resources online and it is so valuable to have a solid Git routine. 

My main Git tips are:

1. Rebase your branches off main as soon as something new gets merged into the main branch. Nobody wants to deal with a merge conflict on a branch that is multiple commits behind the main branch.

2. Try not to have multiple branches/PRs open. Finish one thing, put it in for review and move on to the next. Unless of course you are absolutely stuck or an PR with higher priority than your current one has been assigned to you. 

3. Don't copy code between branches. Just don't.


# 3. A good process


One thing I learned from my dev husband (Hi [Alan](https://alanvardy.com/)!) is the importance of having a good process in place. By that, I mean finding a good way how to tackle work and the various responsibilities consistently every day. A routine if you so will. Everybody is different, so what works for me might not be the best fit for you, but here are some more general tips:

1.  Find your prime work times. I'm that weirdo who likes early mornings (and also Mondays) so I try to get some deep work in early in the morning before my family wakes up. I've noticed that my brain stops functioning somewhere around 5 PM so I try to stop before it grinds to a complete standstill. 


2. Establish routines. What do you do when you first switch on the computer? What works best for you? Find out and do it consistently. I have made it a habit to check the main branch of the repo before I do any work and rebase my branches if need be. I also start work on a new ticket in the same way every time. I feel like having those routines in place is one less thing to think about.

3. Make notes for yourself. I find it helpful to write down the next steps for the ticket I am working on and I leave notes for my morning self every evening before I shut down for the night. 


# 4. Set-up


Less than two month into the new job and I don't recognize myself anymore. I remember vividly that I told somebody less than half a year ago that mechanical keyboards were weird and that I hated the sound of my husband typing (Cherry Brown). Guess who is clicking away on Cherry Blues now? 
I also invested into a bigger screen. But you know what: it's worth it. Having the ability to see my ticket, my code editor (in a larger window now) and what I'm producing on localhost has improved my life tremendously.
Here is a picture of my current set-up. Luckily my little desk has a drawer. Otherwise I would have needed a bigger desk. Shout-out to my son who let me borrow his Squishmallow as a rubber ducky substitute. Now I am slightly less crazy because I'm talking to the Squishmallow and not to myself when I'm coding.

# 5. Communication


Working on a team means working with people, i.e. communication. Finding a good way to communicate with the teammates and people in charge is another important skill to learn. 
I find it's even more challenging when everybody is working remotely and most of the communication happens asynchronously via Slack messages. No immediate feedback. No facial expressions that tell you that
you might have been misunderstood. 

# 6. Work-life boundaries or the curse of notifications


This is what your mother warned you about.
