I am currently nearing the finish line of my own job hunt (or so I hope). As I am "patiently" waiting for my first employment contract to be sent to me, I find myself with a lot of nervous energy and time on my hands. What better thing to do than to post some tips that might help others in their job hunt.

# 1. Where I come from and where I am at right now


I am a translator turned web developer, i.e. I have a non-tech background. Elixir is my first programming language, or at least the first in which I am pursuing a career. That's the short version. The long version is available on my [About me](https://connie.codes/about) page. 

As I am writing this post, I have successfully completed the interviewing phase with one company and am waiting for them to send me my contract. I might also still hear back from a second company with which I interviewed last week. Exciting times.

Since there are already a lot of helpful posts and articles on specific application steps (e.g. resume writing, technical interview) out there, I will keep this post more general and instead provide a few of my favorite pieces of advice per step.
