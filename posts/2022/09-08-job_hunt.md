I am currently nearing the finish line of my own job hunt (or so I hope). As I am "patiently" waiting for my first employment contract to be sent to me, I find myself with a lot of nervous energy and time on my hands. What better thing to do than to post some tips that might help others in their job hunt.

# 1. Where I come from and where I am at right now


I am a translator turned web developer, i.e. I have a non-tech background. Elixir is my first programming language, or at least the first in which I am pursuing a career. That's the short version. The long version is available on my [About me](https://connie.codes/about) page. 

As I am writing this post, I have successfully completed the interviewing phase with one company and am waiting for them to send me my contract. I might also still hear back from a second company with which I interviewed last week. Exciting times.

Since there are already a lot of helpful posts and articles on specific application steps (e.g. resume writing, technical interview) out there, I will keep this post more general and instead provide a few of my favorite pieces of advice for each step.


# 2. Before you apply


If you are considering a developer career at all (even if you're just playing with the idea), start building your portfolio right away. Be visible. Get familiar with your code editor and git and put your work on GitHub. That way, potential employers who are visiting your GitHub site will see all those green squares and know that you have been coding consistently. 
If you have built something cool, pin the repo and show it off.

You can always delete repos later or make them private, but you cannot build a commit history. I think we might be a bit ashamed of our code sometimes (I know, I cringe when I look at stuff I wrote a few months ago). But even if our past projects are far from perfect, they still show that we a) built something and b) that we have developed, since the code in more recent repos will (hopefully) be less cringeworthy.
