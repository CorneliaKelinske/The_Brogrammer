Tips for hunting down that elusive first job

I am currently nearing the finish line of my own job hunt (or so I hope). As I am "patiently" waiting for my first employment contract to be sent to me, I find myself with a lot of nervous energy and time on my hands. What better thing to do than to post some tips that might help others in their job hunt.

# 1. Where I come from and where I am at right now


I am a translator turned web developer, i.e. I have a non-tech background. Elixir is my first programming language, or at least the first in which I am pursuing a career. That's the short version. The long version is available on my [About me](https://connie.codes/about) page. 

As I am writing this post, I have successfully completed the interviewing phase with one company and am waiting for them to send me my contract. I might also still hear back from a second company with which I interviewed last week. Exciting times.

Since there are already a lot of helpful posts and articles on specific application steps (e.g. resume writing, technical interview) out there, I will keep this post more general and instead provide a few of my favorite pieces of advice for each step.


# 2. The moment you consider a programming career


If you are considering a developer career at all (even if you're just playing with the idea), start building your portfolio right away. Be visible. Get familiar with your code editor and git and put your work on GitHub. That way potential employers who are visiting your GitHub site will see all those green squares and know that you have been coding consistently. 
If you have built something cool, pin the repo and show it off.

You can always delete repos later or make them private, but you cannot build a commit history. I think we might be a bit ashamed of our code sometimes (I know, I cringe when I look at stuff I wrote just a few months ago). But even if our past projects are far from perfect, they still show that we a) built something and b) that we have developed, since the code in more recent repos will (hopefully) be less cringe-worthy.


# 3. Before you apply


Let's assume you have put the idea of becoming a developer into action, you have put in the work and you are actively looking for a job. Once again, it is worth to do some upfront work. 

Double-check your GitHub profile. Spruce it up. Pin your best repos, upload a good profile picture and add a profile [README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

Create a LinkedIn profile, add any relevant skills, education and employment history and link your GitHub page. You can also mark yourself as "Open to work". To be honest, I am not a big fan of LinkedIn and I can't say that it has helped me much in my job hunt, however, I did notice that a lot of the online application forms I filled in asked for a LinkedIn page, so I guess it is still good to have one in place.

Put some effort into your resume, both with regard to content and the design. Especially if you are an absolute newbie and maybe a candidate that companies might be more inclined to dismiss due to the lack of production experience, you want to make sure that your resume stands out (in a good way) from the rest. I used [Canva](canva.com) to create mine, and I must say, I'm pretty pleased with the result. Make sure you list all your technical skills. Mention any programming languages, frameworks, libraries etc. that you have worked with. Once again, I think it is a good idea to provide a link to your GitHub page and if you have any projects deployed, link those as well. Another important factor to consider is that while you might not have experience as a developer, you probably worked in a different job before. Identify the qualities from your previous career that will carry over to your new career and list those as well. To give you an example: as a result of my previous career, I am highly organized, reliable, good at communicating, able to work independently, but also as part of a team etc. You get the idea. The message you want to send is "I will be a good employee/contractor".

Another thing I recommend preparing is a cover letter. I used Canva for making a nice one, but I also had a simple Google doc where I just typed down a rough version. I'm not saying you should send the same letter to any company. You'll still have to make individual adjustments. But there is a certain structure and certain points that I included in all my cover letters. I start out with saying where I read the job ad and what I liked about the job description and/or the company. I then highlight some of my experience in Elixir (projects, courses) as well as the professional experience I have due to my previous career. And I conclude with a link to my GitHub page.

I also have a few lines saved in Google docs that I can use when I am contacting somebody on Slack. Once again, it's just the basic text that I can use as a starting point.


# 4. When you apply


The first question is probably: where do you find job opportunities to apply for. My two go-to places for the most up-to-date offers are the Elixir Slack job channel and the [Elixir Forum](https://elixirforum.com/c/work/elixir-jobs/16). 
If you are subscribed to newsletters of community members who are recruiting, reaching out is certainly a great idea.

If you are a junior developer, you'll probably notice that the vast majority of job offers is for seniors. In addition, the few opportunities that are advertised as "Junior/Mid-level" often want somebody with little to no Elixir knowledge but 5+ years of production experience in another language. So what do you do, if you are a newbie like me, with no prior programming experience?
You apply anyway. You have nothing to loose and everything to gain. Just be honest about where you are at in your career.
Don't worry if you don't meet all the requirements listed in the job descriptions. Somebody more experienced once told me that they are more like a wish list and not set in stone.
This being said, I still think it makes sense to take a minute to decide whether an application is worth it. I, for example, will not apply if they are expressly looking for people in Europe, super senior roles or full-stack developers. I'm also more reluctant if the offer is by an early start-up or involves betting or NFTs/crypto stuff.
