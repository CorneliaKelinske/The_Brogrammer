# 1. Previously on this blog

In [part 1](https://connie.codes/post/graphql_subscription_setup), we learned how to set up subscriptions. In [part 2](https://connie.codes/post/graphql_subscription_testing_pt.1), we looked at how we can test subscriptions that are automatically triggered by the corresponding mutation. Now, in this part 3, we will go one step further and test manually triggered subscriptions. If you are brave and bear with me 'til the end, I will throw in a little extra tidbit of knowledge.
