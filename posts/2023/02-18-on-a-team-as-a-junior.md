If you know me or have been reading previous blog posts, you know that the past six months have been quite a wild ride for me: job hunt, first job,
no job and finally the second job. While there are a lot of things that I was able to learn during job number 1, this second job brings along its own set of challenges. My biggest struggle right now is to find ways to learn, grow and contribute as a junior developer on a small team in a startup environment, where everything needs to be done yesterday. Luckily I was able to ask some very helpful and knowledgeable folks - big shout-out - to everyone in the Groxio Elixir Chatt - for their advice. Here is what they suggested.

# 1. A few words about my job


I'm once again working on a small team for a startup. This time, though, I'm the only junior. The app that we're working on already exists as a legacy JavaScript app and we are switching it over to Elixir. My teammate, who is also in charge of the legacy app and does both backend and frontend, has already built most of the Elixir app over the last few months. So he knows the codebase inside out. While he has designed the Elixir app mostly himself, he has gotten some advice from the third person on the team, a seasoned architect, who is now also there to support us. The launch date for the Elixir app is around the corner, so there is some pressure building up, especially for my teammate. 

I've been there for a month and I'm starting to gain a better understanding of the codebase and the business. But I'm also acutely aware of all the things I don't know. Especially during the ticket grooming sessions, where I'm not sure which questions I need to ask to gain clarity. Often, tickets will make sense to me on the surface level, but once I start working on something, all the deeper questions arise.
