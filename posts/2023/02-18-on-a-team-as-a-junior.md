How to find your place, contribute and grow as a junior developer

If you know me or have been reading previous blog posts, you know that the past six months have been quite a wild ride for me: job hunt, first job,
no job and finally the second job. While there are a lot of things that I was able to learn during job number 1, this second job brings along its own set of challenges as I'm experiencing for the first time what it is like to work in an unfamiliar codebase. Luckily I was able to ask some very helpful and knowledgeable folks - big shout-out to everyone in the Groxio Elixir Chatt - for their advice. Here is what they suggested.

# A few words about my job


I'm once again working on a small team for a startup. This time, though, I'm the only junior. The app that we're working on already exists as a legacy JavaScript app and we are switching it over to Elixir. My teammate has already built most of the Elixir app over the last year. He knows the codebase inside out. While he has designed the Elixir app mostly himself, he has gotten some advice from the third person on the team, a seasoned architect, who is now also there to support us. The launch date for the Elixir app is around the corner, so there is some pressure building up, especially for my teammate. 

I've been there for a month and I'm starting to gain a better understanding of the codebase and the business. But I'm also acutely aware of all the things I don't know. My biggest challenge right now is finding ways to contribute, learn and grow as a developer while being respectful of my teammates' time. 

And now, without further ado, here is the advice I got from my peers and mentors:


# 1. Breaking things down


This one is almost generally applicable: if any task seems too complex, break it down into smaller pieces. Get started with the things you can do and then do some research and ask the questions on the remaining portions. Break tickets down into smaller tickets. It's easier to be unblocked from small obstacles and easier to get answers to more targeted questions. In addition, by breaking things down, you will gain a clearer picture of the task at hand and the individual steps can be your road map toward the solution.


# 2. Do some research before asking questions


You might even find the solution on your own. And if not, you will at least have a clearer understanding of the problem and your team will see that you put in an effort. I might have mentioned this before, but I really try to avoid to ask questions that can be answered with "Read the error message" or "Let me google this for you".


# 3. Find a mentor


This is another solid piece of advice. I can't express how grateful I am for all the people in my life who have mentored me in various ways.

If you are new to Elixir or programming and if you're still a bit unsure about the whole thing and maybe not confident to reach out to anyone, let me tell you: the Elixir community is amazing. Almost everybody I have met on my coding journey so far has been helpful and welcoming. On this note, fee free to [contact me](https://connie.codes/contact) if there is anything I can help you with.


# 4. Follow the routes ...


if the app you're working on is a Phoenix app. By checking out the routes and seeing what leads to what, you will gain a much better understanding of your app's logic.

# 7. Make decisions, just do, ultimatum

# 8. Grooming: ready to be worked on? (by somebody who did not write it)

1. knowing when 
Especially during the ticket grooming sessions, where I'm not sure which questions I need to ask to gain clarity. Often, tickets will make sense to me on the surface level, but once I start working on something, all the deeper questions arise.
