How to find your place, contribute and grow as a junior developer

If you know me or have been reading previous blog posts, you know that the past six months have been quite a wild ride for me: job hunt, first job,
no job and finally the second job. While there are a lot of things that I was able to learn during job number 1, this second job brings along its own set of challenges as I'm experiencing for the first time what it is like to work in an unfamiliar codebase. Luckily I was able to ask some very helpful and knowledgeable folks - big shout-out to everyone in the Groxio Elixir Chatt - for their advice. Here is what they suggested.

# 1. A few words about my job


I'm once again working on a small team for a startup. This time, though, I'm the only junior. The app that we're working on already exists as a legacy JavaScript app and we are switching it over to Elixir. My teammate, who is also in charge of the legacy app and does both backend and frontend, has already built most of the Elixir app over the last few months. He knows the codebase inside out. While he has designed the Elixir app mostly himself, he has gotten some advice from the third person on the team, a seasoned architect, who is now also there to support us. The launch date for the Elixir app is around the corner, so there is some pressure building up, especially for my teammate. 

I've been there for a month and I'm starting to gain a better understanding of the codebase and the business. But I'm also acutely aware of all the things I don't know. My biggest challenge right now is finding ways to contribute, learn and grow as a developer while being respectful of my teammates' time. 

And now, without further ado, here is the advice I got from my peers and mentors:

# 2. Break things down into smaller things - smaller tickets, targeted questions

# 3. Make an effort to research answers first before asking teammates

# 4. Get a mentor

# 5. Check out routes and GraphiQL

# 6. Document

# 7. Make decisions, just do, ultimatum

# 8. Grooming: ready to be worked on? (by somebody who did not write it)

1. knowing when 
Especially during the ticket grooming sessions, where I'm not sure which questions I need to ask to gain clarity. Often, tickets will make sense to me on the surface level, but once I start working on something, all the deeper questions arise.
